description: Create a step-by-step learning plan for a topic with docs and progressive challenges
---

Create a comprehensive learning plan for the specified topic. Structure it as a progression from guided to independent learning.

## Research Requirements

BEFORE creating the plan, you MUST:

- Research the topic thoroughly using available tools (WebSearch, context7, WebFetch)
- For libraries/frameworks: use context7 to get current documentation and examples
- Verify all documentation links are valid and current by fetching them
- Find official getting started guides and installation instructions
- Identify the most relevant and up-to-date resources
- Confirm all links work before including them in the plan

## Plan Structure

**Introduction**

- Brief description of what the topic/library is (2-3 sentences)
- What problems it solves and when to use it
- If it's a library: include installation/setup code with link to getting started guide

**Phase 1: Foundation (Guided)**

- Core concepts to understand
- Essential documentation to read (with links)
- Basic examples to review
- Specific step-by-step exercises with clear instructions

**Phase 2: Practice (Semi-Guided)**

- Intermediate concepts and patterns
- Practical implementation tasks
- Less prescriptive steps - describe what to build, not exactly how
- Encourage experimentation and exploration

**Phase 3: Further Reading (Optional)**

- Advanced concepts and deep dives
- Integration patterns with other tools/libraries
- Real-world scenarios and best practices
- End with: "Once you've completed the previous phases, let me know if you'd like to continue with these advanced topics!"

## Format Requirements

- Use checkboxes: `- [ ]` for each actionable step
- Include context7 documentation links where relevant
- Brief explanations (1-2 sentences) for each section
- Gradually reduce specificity: start with "Create X by doing Y" → end with "Build X that solves Y"
- Mix reading/learning steps with hands-on implementation
- Progressive difficulty: concrete → open-ended
- Any links must be on a newline to prevent issues with text wrapping in the terminal

## Response Style

- Clear progression markers (Foundation → Practice → Further Reading)
- Actionable items the user can check off
- Balance between guidance and independence
- Encourage experimentation in later phases

Now create the learning plan for the specified topic.
